It has become one of the leading FinTech companies in it's domain, and was incorporated in August 2011.  The founders of SoFi Inc. are Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finningain, and Ian Brady. The idea for SoFi originated from the aforementioned individuals while they were gradute students at Stanford University.

"##Recommendations"
---
Although SoFi Inc. has been successful over the past decade, if they were able to incorporate a Loan Forgiveness Program for student loans, I believe it would be a very successful program.  Many student are struggling to pay their student loan debt and it usually takes student decades to do it.  If a student loan forgiveness program was implemented, it would broaden their customer base from a volume standpoint. While the customers are taking advantage of the student loan forgiveness program, it would allow SoFi Inc. to offer more products and services to their customers, thus bringing in more revenue. There are a number of technologies that can be incorporated to acclomplish this program which include artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain technology, and big data and analytics.
